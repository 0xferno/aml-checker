# AML checker script‚ö°
*Anti-money laundering (AML) refers to the activities financial institutions perform to achieve compliance with legal requirements to actively monitor for and report suspicious activities*

**This program contains complete global databases of sanctioned addresses and regularly monitors public and closed sources, blacklists of coins and wallets. The developed algorithm allows the address to be quickly linked to various criminal or prohibited activities in accordance with legal requirements and AML/CTF requirements.
The algorithm identifies all connections and conditionally divides them into safe and risky ones. The risks are assessed by analyzing the total number of found ‚Äúclean‚Äù and ‚Äúdirty‚Äù assets that passed through these links.
The system processes the obtained data and provides a final risk assessment with recommendations**
